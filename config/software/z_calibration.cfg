# Switch offset (default D2F-5: 0.5mm and SSG-5H: 0.7mm)
# Smaller number means higher nozzle to the PEI
# The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   Larger values will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   Decreasing the "switch_offset" will move the nozzle more away from the bed.
